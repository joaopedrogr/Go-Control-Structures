# Go Control Structures

## ðŸ“˜ Description
The Go-Control-Structures repository provides an in-depth guide to control flow mechanisms in the Go programming language. This repository is ideal for developers who want to master Go's control structures through practical examples and well-structured code snippets.

Key topics covered:

- Conditional Statements: Learn how to use if, else if, and else for decision-making.
- Switch Statements: Implement clean and efficient control flow using switch.
- Loops: Understand for loops and their variations.
- Defer, Panic, and Recover: Manage errors and cleanup operations effectively.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple sections to facilitate easy navigation and learning.

### **Main Files**
### Conditionals/
This folder contains examples that demonstrate Goâ€™s decision-making structures:

- if_else.go: Demonstrates the use of if, else if, and else statements.
- nested_if.go: Shows how to nest conditional statements for complex logic.
- logical_operators.go: Illustrates logical operators (&&, ||, !) in conditions.

### Loops/
This folder highlights different looping mechanisms available in Go:

- for_loop.go: Basic for loop with initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
- while_simulation.go: Using a for loop to mimic a while loop.
- range_loop.go: Iterating over slices, maps, and arrays with range.
- break_continue.go: Demonstrates break and continue statements.

### Switch/
This folder covers Goâ€™s switch statement and its capabilities:

- basic_switch.go: Simple switch-case statement usage.
- fallthrough.go: Example of fallthrough in switch cases.
- multiple_cases.go: Handling multiple cases in a single branch.

### Error Handling/
This section explains Go's built-in error handling techniques:

- defer_example.go: Using defer to ensure cleanup operations execute.
- panic_example.go: Demonstrating panic for unexpected errors.
- recover_example.go: Using recover to handle panics gracefully.
